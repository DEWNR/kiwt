                <p>Day one commences at the Flinders Chase Visitor Centre and takes you to the famous Rocky River Platypus Waterholes where you may encounter the rare and iconic platypus. This shared section of the trail has plenty of interpretation and offers a great introduction to the park. When the path joins up with the Rocky River Trail you’ll be immersed in dense eucalypt woodland teeming with bird life and native animals. Reaching a lookout you will see the meandering Rocky River far below you as it flows out towards the Southern Ocean. You will then pass through riverbank and mallee habitats where wildflowers provide stunning arrays of colour all year around, along with a profusion of orchids and fungi in the cooler months. Traversing your way down from the ridge towards the river you will come across the spectacular sight of the Rocky River Cascades. The day comes to a close at the Cup Gum campsite, a peaceful setting for your first night’s rest hidden amongst sugar gums and ancient old growth cup gums.</p>
